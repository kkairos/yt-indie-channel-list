# YT Indie Game Channel List

List of indie game-dev friendly youtube channels with some info, and whether they take submissions.

Obviously very much a WIP since there's only like four in the list ATM. But I thought it would be good to have something to share with folks.

In case you're the sort of person like me who would care, I don't mind this list being reposted but if you do would appreciate credit.

Also depending on the livestreamer, they may focus more on their existing community, but I'm mentioning everything I can think of, not trying to be exhaustive so I'll stop typing this now.
