# YT Indie Game Channel List

List of indie game-dev friendly youtube channels with some info, and whether they take submissions.

Obviously very much a WIP since there's only like four in the list ATM. But I thought it would be good to have something to share with folks.

In case you're the sort of person like me who would care, I don't mind this list being reposted but if you do would appreciate credit.
